# 🧠 Django Projects Hub

Welcome to the **Django Projects Hub** – a centralized repository where we will build and maintain a series of Django-based web applications. Each project will focus on solving real-world problems while showcasing best practices in full-stack development using **Django**, **Chart.js**, **Django Channels**, and other modern web tools.

This folder acts as a workspace to explore, learn, and master Django through diverse and scalable applications – ranging from food management to chat apps and marketplace platforms.
